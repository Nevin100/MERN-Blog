            This month, the National Press Photographers Association (NPPA)
            revealed their Best of Photojournalism awards. It was our first time
            entering this prestigious competition, and we won first and third
            place in the picture editing magazine cover category. While the
            Science Visuals photo team assigns original photography for some of
            our covers, a large portion of the photographs we highlight are the
            result of the teamâ€™s finely honed research skills. They find photos
            of the right thing, in the right place, at the right time.
